While we wait forEthereum to move to Ethereum 2.0(planned for 2022), there are solutions that solve the problem of high transaction costs: Layer 2. <br><br>Layer 2 is defined as “a collective term for solutions designed to helpscale your application by handling transactions off the EthereumMainnet (layer 1) while taking advantage of the robust decentralizedsecurity model of Mainnet”.They are networks that are built “on top” ofthe Ethereum blockchain that can handle transaction fees off of theoriginal Ethereum blockchain.This alleviates the number of transactionsper second made on the original Ethereum chain, or Layer 1, which allows to scale and therefore decrease the transaction, or gas costs. <br><br>We believe Layer 1 will continue to act as a valuable base issuance andsettlement layer for protocol assets. Whereas, on Layer 2, developersand end-users will want to take advantage of the off-chain transactionsand computations to keep the base layer free of congestion.

With EIP-1559,the base fee will increase and decrease by12.5% after blocks are more than 50% full.For example, if a block is100% full the base fee increases by 12.5%; if it is 50% full the base feewill be the same; if it is 0% full the base fee would decrease by 12.5%. <br><br>The ongoing movement of applications to rollups and Layer 2s willgreatly reduce gas fees."},{id:2,title:"How do l set the right gas fec?",con:"MetaMask will provide you with three options when setting the gas fee: <br><br>“Low”(previously“Low”): is much lower than market prices and itallows a user to pay a lower fee when they are willing to wait a longertime, for example when withdrawing funds or other non-time sensitive transactions.lt allows you to wait a longer period and skipthe price spikes (i.e.save money).This setting is based on past trends, which means we are less sure the transaction goes through. lfyou require a transaction to go through within a specific time frame,this may not be the right setting for you.<br><br>“Market”(previously “Medium”): reflects market prices.<br><br>“Aggressive”(previously“High”): is much higher compared to marketprices.

In essence, it will eliminate the extra step in setting the gasprice to make a transaction."},{id:6,title:"Are gas fees higher on MetaMask than anywhere else?",con:"For the “Market” setting, we do our best to find the right balancebetween cost and confidence/speed.Gas costs are an estimate andwhat you actually pay should be similar across wallets.

Wallets like MetaMask will beable to have better estimates, and won't have to rely much on externaloracles since the base fee is managed by the protocol itself. Additionally, when using MetaMask, you can decide between low,market or aggressive gas fees.Although the recommended type will bepre-selected,the user can change this before confirming the transaction.Additionally, users can change the max fee, max priorityfee, and Gwei in the “Advanced” settings. Doing this will override theinitial low, market, or aggressive settings."},{id:2,title:"ls the user experience going to be different during times of network+congestion?",con:"During periods of high network congestion, the base fee will adjust by12.5% depending how much demand surpasses the ideal gas limit perblock until that demand abates.Instead of a first-price auction, userswill have a better sense of how congested the network is by how highthe base fee is.
